# Project description: 
When creating tilesets in Godot with an artist friend, we had issues with the autotiling node. 
Specifically, the transition from single blob images to the full blob tileset was a pain. 
I decided to make a small script that automates the process of creating blob tile sets. 
The example uses caeles tile setup (which can be found [here](https://opengameart.org/content/seamless-tileset-template-ii)) and a few tiles from [Casey Fallon](http://www.cfallondesign.com/).

# Project dependencies.

* Python 3.6.5


# Instructions to run.

1. Place your default blob tiles into the Blobs folder. Names need to be in accordance with the default blob values in caeles tileset.
2. Run the program in your command line or favorite IDE.
3. Press the blob directory button and lead it to your the directory containing your images.
4. Press the configuration file button and lead it to your packer configuration text file.
5. Press the CreateTileset and wait until Finished has appeared.
6. The resulting tile set will be found within the Finished project folder.
7. Enjoy!
